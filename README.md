# Project 3 - Palindrome Detector
- My submission for Computer Science 131, Section 06
- Objective: To practice the Adapter/Wrapper pattern, learn to implement both a Stack and a Queue using an existing underlying data structure, and combine your new Stack and Queue to write a Palindrome detector
- Disclaimer: This is a project for my CPSC 131 Data Structures Class, created by Professor Peralta at CSUF
